Anderson Acceleration for solving fixed point problems and spin-up of seasonally forced ocean biogeochemical models

This repository contains code for solving fixed point problems using Anderson Acceleration. It is based on 
AndAcc.m originally written by Homer F. Walker (Anderson acceleration: Algorithms and implementations, 
Worcester Polytechnic Institute Mathematical Sciences Department Research Report MS-6-15-50, 10/14/2011) 
with extensive modifications as per Khatiwala, "Fast spin-up of geochemical tracers in ocean circulation 
and climate models, J. Adv. Model. Earth Sys., 2022, doi: xxx. These modifications enable use of the code 
on batch HPC systems for computing equilibrium solutions of periodically-forced ocean models.
